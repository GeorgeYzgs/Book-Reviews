# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this project I have created a book reviewing application where users can search for their favourite books
and leave a personal review.

After registering and logging in a user can search for a book by its title, author or ISBN.
Then in the book's page they can see other user's reviews along with goodreads' ratings for that book.
The user can also leave their unique review with a rating and a comment.

Finally under /api/(isbn) a user can query our api for a json of the book's information and its ratings from our website.

Tha application utilizes goodreads' api along with open library for the book covers.
